# Database schema

[Start here](../README.md) · [Daemon API](daemon-api.md) · [Server startup](server-startup.md)

Thoughtloom uses SQLite through Bun's built-in `bun:sqlite`. The authoritative schema and migration are in [`src/storage/sqlite.ts`](../src/storage/sqlite.ts). This document describes the current schema, not proposed search or agent tables.

## Model and relationships

- A thought is an immutable piece of recorded thinking. A non-root thought has one evolution parent; roots have no parent.
- Titles are separate mutable metadata, returned alongside thoughts in ordinary reads.
- Conceptual connections are separate from evolution ancestry. They never become extra evolution parents or extend the scope of a branch operation.
- Source associations record supporting provenance. Their position preserves the order of each source list.
- Rejection is presence in a separate state table, not deletion or modification of the recorded thought.

Database names use `snake_case`; the [API](daemon-api.md#response-records) uses `camelCase`.

## Tables

Unless marked nullable, columns below are `NOT NULL`. Every listed foreign key references the identified parent row; no cascading-delete action is declared.

### `thoughts`

| Column | Type | Constraint / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `TEXT` | Primary key; assigned by the daemon's creation command. |
| `text` | `TEXT` | Recorded wording. |
| `author` | `TEXT` | Check: `user` or `ai`. |
| `kind` | `TEXT` | Check: `captured-original`, `user-contribution`, `ai-interpretation`, or `developing-idea`. |
| `created_at` | `TEXT` | Daemon-generated UTC ISO timestamp. SQLite itself stores text rather than enforcing timestamp syntax. |
| `origin` | `TEXT` | Provenance label. Current HTTP creation commands use `capture`, `contribution`, or `development`; this column is not a SQL enum. |
| `parent_id` | `TEXT`, nullable | Foreign key to `thoughts.id`; a check forbids self-parenting. |

There is no title column in the current table. `BEFORE UPDATE` and `BEFORE DELETE` triggers abort mutations with an immutability error. Further development creates another thought rather than a revision of this row.

### `thought_titles`

| Column | Type | Constraint / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `thought_id` | `TEXT` | Primary key and foreign key to `thoughts.id`. |
| `title` | `TEXT`, nullable | Current display title. |
| `title_author` | `TEXT`, nullable | Check: `user` or `ai` when present. This is distinct from the thought's author. |

A check requires title and title author to be either both null or both non-null. The primary key permits at most one title record per thought; supported thought saves create the metadata row even when untitled.

Users may edit or clear the title without changing the base thought. Clearing sets both values to null and permits a future AI fill. The title service checks rejection state and current title within a transaction; AI may fill only an active, still-untitled thought. See [`domain/title.ts`](../src/domain/title.ts) and [`storage/title.ts`](../src/storage/title.ts).

### `thought_sources`

| Column | Type | Constraint / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `thought_id` | `TEXT` | Foreign key to the thought receiving provenance. |
| `position` | `INTEGER` | Source-list position. |
| `source_id` | `TEXT` | Foreign key to the supporting thought. |

Composite primary key: `(thought_id, position)`. Sources do not create extra evolution parents.

### `thought_source_seals`

| Column | Type | Constraint / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `thought_id` | `TEXT` | Primary key and foreign key to `thoughts.id`; marks its source set complete. |

`saveThought()` inserts a thought, its title, its source rows, and its seal in one transaction. After sealing, triggers reject new source rows. Updates and deletion of source rows or seals are also rejected. This protects recorded provenance without preventing initial assembly.

### `connections`

| Column | Type | Constraint / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `TEXT` | Primary key; assigned by the daemon. |
| `from_id` | `TEXT` | Foreign key to `thoughts.id`. |
| `to_id` | `TEXT` | Foreign key to `thoughts.id`. |
| `category` | `TEXT` | Check: `supports`, `contradicts`, `extends`, or `related`. |
| `proposed_by` | `TEXT` | Check: `user` or `ai`. |
| `explanation` | `TEXT` | Recorded rationale. |

The endpoints preserve direction where the category is directional. Unlike thoughts and responses, this table has no immutable-update/delete triggers; the current HTTP interface exposes creation and rejection/restoration, not arbitrary record edits.

### `connection_sources`

| Column | Type | Constraint / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connection_id` | `TEXT` | Foreign key to `connections.id`. |
| `position` | `INTEGER` | Source-list position. |
| `source_id` | `TEXT` | Foreign key to a supporting thought. |

Composite primary key: `(connection_id, position)`. Thought-source sealing triggers do not apply to this table.

### `responses`

| Column | Type | Constraint / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `TEXT` | Primary key. |
| `thought_id` | `TEXT` | Foreign key to the associated thought. |
| `text` | `TEXT` | Retained response text. |
| `role` | `TEXT` | Check: `addendum` or `fallback`. |

An addendum accompanies a recorded development. A fallback retains the response when no separate development was recorded. Update/delete triggers protect both roles. The HTTP API can read these records but does not currently provide a response-creation route; real agent integration is still pending.

### Rejection state

| Table | Column | Constraint / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rejected_thoughts` | `thought_id TEXT` | Primary key and foreign key to `thoughts.id`. Presence means rejected. |
| `rejected_connections` | `connection_id TEXT` | Primary key and foreign key to `connections.id`. Presence means explicitly rejected. |

Restoration removes the state marker, not the original record. Branch operations traverse `thoughts.parent_id`, never `connections`.

A connection with a rejected endpoint is unavailable in normal reads even without an explicit connection marker. Restoring endpoints can make it visible again, but a separately rejected connection stays rejected until separately restored.

## Constraints and access boundaries

Migration enables `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` and verifies it, and also enables `PRAGMA recursive_triggers = ON` for the connection. No explicit secondary indexes are currently created beyond primary-key indexes.

SQL constraints and triggers protect persistence invariants; they do not replace service authorization or scoped reads. Raw storage access is internal. Future agents and routes must use the domain services to exclude rejected thought content, ancestry, sources, connections and responses appropriately.

Direct SQL creation is not the supported write boundary. In particular, bypassing `saveThought()` can omit title metadata or leave a source set unsealed. Do not populate application data by inserting partial rows manually.

## Migrations

The daemon calls `migrate()` on opening its database. Bootstrap and schema changes run in an immediate transaction and are safe to repeat; the implementation currently uses schema inspection, not a separate migration-version table.

For the legacy schema with `thoughts.title`, migration:

1. Creates the current tables and triggers if absent and seals source sets for existing thoughts.
2. Detects the old title column with `PRAGMA table_info(thoughts)`.
3. Copies each title into `thought_titles`, assigning a non-null legacy title the original thought's author as title attribution. Untitled rows retain null title/author.
4. Drops the old title column, leaving metadata as the authoritative title source.

Subsequent opens do not recopy cleared titles. Existing identity, text, authorship, dates, ancestry, sources, connections, rejection state and responses are preserved. [Migration tests](testing.md#controlled-inputs-not-production-assumptions) exercise populated legacy fixtures and reopen behavior.

Back up valuable data before upgrading and stop the daemon before replacing a disposable database. No FTS5/search tables or automatic weaver execution are part of this schema yet.
